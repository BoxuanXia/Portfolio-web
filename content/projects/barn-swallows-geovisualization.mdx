## Overview
This ecological project utilized Python to process observation data and visualize location positioning, movement patterns, and estimated nesting sites for Barn Swallows in Argentina.

## Key Outcomes
- Calculated migration distance for multiple sample groups.
- Automated the generation of histograms for migration metrics.
- Leveraged spatial clustering to find high-density nesting incidents.
