## Overview
The 9th Ward area faced a rapid increase in property vacancies. This project utilized spatial modeling to identify hot spots and propose stabilization zones to prevent further urban blight.

## Process
I analyzed property data over a 5-year period to track "drift" in vacancy rates and identified key architectural anchors that, if rehabilitated, would provide the highest ROI for neighborhood stability.
